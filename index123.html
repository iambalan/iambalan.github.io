										He works with three distinct research groups with possible interlinkages resulting in long term economic growth.  
										His core research group focuses on measuring and monitoring outcomes arising out of developmental interventions in 
										‘within country migration’, microfinance, microenterprise development, ICT and citizen center initiatives at the grassroot level.  
										The second group focuses on macro level issues interms of capital flows, Governance and corporate valuations.  
										Their prime focus is in the arena of capital flows and valuations in the e-commerce segment.  
										The third group works on high frequency finance which was his core research area over the last decade and a half.  
										The group focuses on identifying patterns in trading which is the crux given the funds flow and market growth.  </p>

                                                        <h4>Purpose – This paper aims to identify the dimensions of a firm’s service innovation competence. This paper
also aims to establish the relationship between a firm’s service innovation competence dimensions and
customer-oriented service innovation configurations and customer adoption. This study probes the supply
side of service innovation to assess the key drivers or capabilities that influence the service innovation process
at the firm level.
Design/methodology/approach – This study uses the triangulation method using existing theoretical
concept supplemented by 18 in-depth interviews of senior level managers from service firms from three
sectors – hospitality, mobile telecommunication services and financial services. The interview findings were
supplemented by 12 service innovation case studies (four from each sector). Content analysis of in-depth
interviews was performed using three raters, and inter-rater reliability was tested. Case studies were
categorized in terms of the strength of the innovation competence dimension observed.
Findings – Based on the content analysis of the interviews and categorization of case study observations,
six distinct dimensions of the firm’s service innovation competence were identified. Four attributes of each
dimension were also identified. Based on the interview insights and case observations, seven propositions are
suggested, and a conceptual framework is presented to establish the relationship between the firm’s service
innovation competence dimensions and service innovation configurations and customer adoption.
Research limitations/implications – This study was conducted in the Indian context and remains to
be tested using quantitative research. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed framework
in a different geographical context to ascertain its validity.
Practical implications – The conceptual framework presented in the paper may help managers of
service firms in building innovation capabilities that are relevant to development of customer-oriented
innovations. This would lead to better customer adoption of their new services.
Originality/value – This paper fills an important knowledge gap regarding the dimensions of a critical
supply-side component of service innovation, that is, innovation competence. Clear identification of
competence dimensions and their relationship with customer adoption extends the current knowledge on
service innovation.</h4>

lower price as a result of search) when consumers use/do not use recommendation agents (RAs). Specifically,
it studies the effect of RAs/no RAs on decision quality, decision confidence and decision satisfaction taking
into account subjective knowledge (SK) and involvement.
Design/methodology/approach – This paper employed two between-subjects factorial experimental
designs with subjects searching for digital cameras in a simulated online digital camera store. The experiment
was conducted with graduate students in Chennai, Bengaluru and Mysore in India.
Findings – Results of two online experiments showed that when consumers used RAs, low search led to
better decision quality, whereas when consumers did not use RAs, medium search led to optimum decision
quality. When consumers use RAs, SK had a U-shaped influence on the decision quality indicating that
decision quality was the lowest for those with medium SK. When consumers did not use RAs, the effect of SK
on decision quality was an inverted U-shape, indicating optimum decision quality for medium SK consumers.
When consumers did not use RAs, subjects with high involvement made better choices, whereas when
consumers used RAs, low involvement subjects made better choices. However, subjects who searched more
had higher decision confidence and decision satisfaction even if their choices were not better.
Originality/value – The effect of RA vs no RA in conjunction with relevant consumer characteristics
influencing decision quality of the consumer is demonstrated in this study. The findings have important
managerial, consumer and theoretical contributions to make.</h4>

foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow, outflow and domestic investment (DI) for 32 emerging market
economies (EMEs) based on 17 years data from 1996 to 2012. Breitung, IPS and Fisher-ADF tests have been
used to identify the presence of unit root in the panel data. Further, Pedroni‟s panel cointegration test was used
to find long-run relationships among DI, FDI inflow, and FDI outflow. The long-run association was further
confirmed by Westerlund‟s panel cointegration test. Based on panel VECM a joint long-run causality from both
FDI inflow and outflow towards domestic investment was identified. However, in the short-run domestic
investment was caused by FDI inflow. Further applying fully modified OLS (FMOLS) and dynamic OLS
(DOLS) it was observed that FDI inflow and FDI outflow have crowding-in effects on domestic investment. It
can be concluded that for EMEs FDI outflow is also equally important in addition to FDI inflow to augment
domestic investment. The impact of 2008 crisis was also examined in the light of FDI outflows and inflows
from EMEs. Results based on FMOLS and DOLS indicate that 2008 crisis negatively affected the FDI inflow
but the effect on outflows was not statistically significant. These results advocate for a protection mechanism
from the financial crises for the EMEs as the FDI inflow declined during the period.

examines the motives for forming IJVs in the auto component sector and also
identifies the criteria for choosing the joint venture partner to mitigate conflicts. These
two specific attributes form the core towards transfer of technology, promoting
innovation and also act as a catalyst for adopting and choosing appropriate technology.
The study brings out the relationship between motives, partner selection criteria and
performance of the IJVs. Results indicate that firms gave maximum importance to
technological skills, quality control measures and proprietary knowledge in selecting
IJV partners. It is also observed that the motives affect the partner selection criteria in
terms of skill and resources needed from the partner.

														This finding is consistent with the complementary hypothesis of neoclassical macroeconomic growth model in which

changes around bonus and rights issue announcements, using historical volatility estimation and time
varying volatility approach.
Design/methodology/approach – Changes in volatility around bonus and rights issues have been
examined using the following methodologies. First, to capture historical volatility, change in standard
deviation for 20 days and 100 days before and after announcement have been examined. Second,
change in time varying volatility and unconditional volatility is examined using GARCH (1, 1) model.
Findings – The results indicate that the historical volatility has increased after bonus and rights issue
announcement. The volatility persistence and unconditional variance have increased after the bonus
and rights issue announcements. This evidence, extendable to any other type of issue announcement, is
consistent with theories stating that volatility increases after the seasoned capital issue announcements.
Originality/value – This study analyses historical volatility, volatility persistence and unconditional
volatility around bonus and rights issue announcements, which has not been observed in the previous
literature. This study fills the gap in literature by empirically examining the change in short- and
long-term volatility before and after bonus and rights issue announcements. Moreover, measuring
volatility using GARCH model overcomes the potential problem of heteroscedasticity associated with
cross-sectional data. The change in volatility persistence and unconditional volatility before and after
the announcement are also examined. This study is useful for researchers and practitioners specialized
in finance, international business and management, and professionals in the area of commercial policy
development in emerging markets.</h4>

                                                        <h4>Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the short-term stock market interactions between
US and six major Asian markets – China, India, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.
These six economies along with Japan and Australia have the largest stock exchanges in the
Asia-Pacific region. The importance of the US market to the Asian economies is the prime motivation
for a quantitative assessment of its role in this region. The objective of this study is to measure the
dynamic stock market interdependence of US and Asian newly industrialized economies (NIEs)
(Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan) and emerging market economies (EMEs) (China
and India) post Asian crisis of 1997 and also to capture the market interactions during the sub-prime
crisis.
Design/methodology/approach – The study has employed Granger causality tests and
generalized forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) analysis to analyze the fluctuations in
and the extent of short-term interdependence between the US and Asian economies. VAR model was
estimated to run the simulations for FEVD analysis.
Findings – The empirical results from FEVD analysis revealed the dominance of US stock market
on Asian markets; the USA being a large economy of the world, an important trading partner and
major supplier of capital to Asian region. Stock markets of Asia are not immune to the shocks
originating in the USA although the effects of shocks vary considerably across markets. Further,
an important implication is that major crisis events can influence the relationship among stock
markets.
Originality/value – This is one of the first papers in the Asian context examining the
interdependence with the US markets. Hence, even though most of the Asian economies went
through liberalization, the macroeconomic and financial circumstances were very different before,
after and during the process. This motivated the examination of the interactions between US and other
Asian markets.</h4>

between emerging (India, China, South Korea, and Taiwan) and developed stock markets (USA and
Japan). The study aims at adding to the literature on market integration by investigating the
hypothesis that the Asian emerging stock markets are increasingly converging with the US stock
market over time.
Design/methodology/approach – The authors use time varying cointegration tests (rolling and
recursive cointegration) which allow for time variation in the underlying data generating process
(possible structural breaks in the long-run relationships). Ten year index data from mid 1998 to 2008 of
the respective stock markets have been used for this study.
Findings – Empirical findings support the presence of one long-run relationship (cointegration vector)
between emerging and developed stock markets. Both domestic and external forces affect stock market
behavior, leading to long-run equilibrium but the individual Asian emerging stock markets tend to
display stronger linkages with the USA (developed counterpart) rather than with their neighbors. The
degree of convergence among Asian emerging markets has increased over the last few years.
Originality/value – This is the first paper to study cointegration among Asian emerging stock
markets namely India, China, South Korea, and Taiwan, as well as their cointegration with the
developed stock markets of the USA and Japan.</h4>

non-marketable asset (human capital), along with other factors predicting stock returns, explain risk
return relationship. The paper will add to the literature on risk return relationship with human capital
by investigating the hypothesis that human capital is a significant factor affecting stock prices.
Design/methodology/approach – The dynamic inter-linkages of factors representing financial
and human components of wealth in predicting stock returns is tested in the Indian market for the
period of 1996:04 to 2005:06. The procedures employed include Granger causality tests, impulse
response functions and seemingly unrelated regression estimates.
Findings – Empirical findings validate the model that including human capital as a proxy for
aggregate wealth in the economy can better predict stock prices than the standard empirical capital
asset pricing model. There is a Granger cause relationship between security prices and labor income
and it is further concluded that labor and dividend are significant factors affecting security prices.
Originality/value – This is one of the first papers to study the human capital aspect in predicting
stock returns in the Indian market. In addition, the paper provides important insights into the causal
relationship of human capital and market return in explaining the risk return relationship.</h4>

It was observed that there was a significant market reaction to the buy-back announcements during the announcement period viz. the announcement date and the day prior to it. The market reaction t persists on the first day after the announcement of buy-backs regardless of the buy-back mechanisms adopted by the firms. The analysis suggests that the share prices which recorded a rapid decline prior to the buy-back announcement remained almost constant for a few days immediately following the announcement and then declined again, but at a much slower pace. A pattern similar to that of the post announcement period was also observed after the occurrence of actual buy-back. This study also examines the firms’ choice of repurchase mechanism, and the link between those choices and the share price reaction.</h4>

Entrepreneurship, finance, technology and innovation, general management.
Study level/applicability
This case is suitable for students in finance, entrepreneurship and general management. The case seeks to understand the challenges of funding in technology startups and how they vary from product to service areas.
Case overview
Availability of capital, short term and long term, is a major constraint faced by entrepreneurs. In India, in the technology sector, services companies have been able to innovate and grow whereas product-based companies that survived the challenges of funding have been scarce. Aluru Karthik Prasanth is presented in the case as a young entrepreneur with passion and drive to pursue the commercialization of an idea he developed during his undergraduate studies in engineering. Leaving behind the beaten paths ofMTech and employment, he decides to pursue MS entrepreneurship at IIT Madras. As he starts with his program, he analyses the challenges faced by previous technology start ups, Karthik has a dilemma – deciding whether to follow a product idea or change his plans to a technology service.
Expected learning outcomes
A detailed analysis of the case would help students address the following questions in entrepreneurial decision making: should an entrepreneur in technology in India pursue a product idea or service idea?. What are the pros and cons of each choice in financing? How can an entrepreneur pursue a product idea and minimize his/her risks? How does an entrepreneur's personal attributes influence his/her course? (e.g. family background, need for control) What are the challenges and opportunities in each kind of funding: debt, venture, angel, etc. in the Indian context?</h4>

Event study methodology has been used for the purpose of studying the rights issue announcement reaction. Liquidity changes around the rights issue announcement have been captured using the trading volume, raw trading volume and liquidity ratios. Rights issue announcement yields a positive return around the announcements date in the case of textile, IT and finance sectors, whereas, in the case of chemical sector, the rights issue announcement yields a negative reaction. The results of the study show that in the case of chemical and finance sectors, the stock market is semi strong form efficient as against textile and IT sectors. In the post announcement period, the announcement reaction is positive for textile and finance sectors and negative for chemical and IT sectors. The rights issue announcement reflects investor’s sentiments about the market as a whole. Liquidity has decreased across all sectors as the liquidity ratio which captured market depth is significantly negative for all sectors under study. 
														The study supports signaling hypothesis and information content hypothesis, but rejects liquidity hypothesis.</h4>

due to merger announcements. The role of insider information before merger announcements is also empirically tested
and explained to be the cause for observed pre-announcement price run-ups. The investigation has been carried out
using traditional event study methodology. Various event windows have been considered and compared to find out the
period where the price run-up initiates. The post-merger price variations have also been studied. This analysis is
suggestive of an upward trend in cumulative abnormal returns for companies in the pre-announcement period which in
turn is indicative of insider information or anticipation. In addition, the evidence also suggests that around the
announcement period the returns for the acquiring companies are higher than those for the target companies. In the post
amalgamation period there is a downward trend in the cumulative returns implying a negative result of the merger. </h4>

														Results of our analysis suggest that human capital is a significant factor in the prediction of stock returns. With the inclusion of human capital the explanatory power of the variables improves remarkably. Human capital has a significant causal relationship with stock returns; in the presence of Fama- French factors it shows a causal relationship with market risk.

announcements of rights issues in the Indian Stock Market. This paper also
examines Information hypothesis, Price pressure hypothesis, Market condition
hypothesis and Semi strong form efficient market hypothesis. The event study
technique has been used along with Multivariate Regression Analysis. The
results of the study show that Indian stock market reacts positively to the
announcement of rights issue and there is no information leakage prior to the
rights issue in India. There is little evidence on the Indian stock market being
semi strong form efficient. There is no evidence to support the Market condition
hypothesis and Information hypothesis but there is evidence of Price pressure
hypothesis.

														It is also observed that there is no information leakage prior to the announcement. Reduction in the liquidity ratio after the announcement is evidenced,
														though insignificant. All the three liquidity measures seem to be inconsistent with the enhanced trading liquidity expectation. Cross sectional regression shows that
														the number of shares issued, convey a positive signal to the investors. Further it has been evidenced that the size of the firm issuing bonus shares does not
														affect the abnormal returns of the company. The study supports Signaling Hypothesis and Cash Substitution Hypothesis.

public offerings (IPOs) that tapped the Indian primary market through a fixed price offer and book building offer; also to
assess the persistence of underperformance between these two routes of offering.
Design/methodology/approach: The after market performance of the IPOs is empirically assessed based on their market
prices and also taking into consideration the other factors associated with the after market performance such as the period
of issue (boom/slump), sector in which the industry is operating, etc.
Findings: The results suggest that there is no difference in the direction of performance of the issues post listing in the short
run, however in the long run the issues that tapped the market through the book building route seemed to perform far better
than the ones that raised money through a fixed price offer. The results also suggested that the average return irrespective of
the route of issue remains the same and this is because of the high initial return of issues that tapped the market with fixed price
offers.
Originality/value: The paper provides useful information about the IPO markets of India and abroad, related literature and
theories or hypotheses concerning methods of issue.</h4>

Most of these initiatives by the government towards payer targeted programs are fairly recent.
